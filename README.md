# dahlia-calculator
Calculator application for dahliaOS

##Important Style guide!
All dahlia applications MUST have a central theme color, that is not #ff5722, or material-deeporange or similar, as that is reserved for the system. Uploaders must upload a theme.txt in the root of their application, that contains the theme color, in preferably hexadecimal, but RGBA is acceptable as well. Uncompliant applications will have their theme colors set to a random color.
